#  California Forest Lidar Analytics Collaborative 


##Overview
###  California is in an unprecedented period of change in forest management.  The dual mandates of public safety from wildfire and climate mitigation are clearly articulated objectives in management plans across the State.  We are in an era of broad political and technical consensus on approaches for delivering on these objectives.  In order to achieve these pace and scale goals, we also need to scale our analytic capacity using the best available geospatial tools.  Point cloud analysis from airborne lidar and photogrammetry is the leading technology for this mission.  These technologies have matured to a point where reliable long term workflows are feasible and necessary.  Landscape wide lidar coverages are increasingly available. Focused efforts to operationalize these tools are now needed at the planning unit scale.
